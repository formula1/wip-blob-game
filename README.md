# wip-blob-game
Blob game I was working on from a year back

This requires a few other repositories to work

* https://github.com/formula1/Java-Box2d-Helper
* https://github.com/formula1/jinput-gamecore
* https://github.com/formula1/JFrame-Launcher-Gamecore

I haven't worked on it in a while in addition it was in eclipse. So I can't say for sure how to build it now adays.
It was uploaded mostly because I'm cleaning out my windows and I did spend a lot of time and emotion in this.
Even if it isn't completed, I'm confident I can use some things form it in the future
