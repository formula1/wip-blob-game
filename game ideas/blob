The Blob

Why a blob?
-Ledge Hanging
-Soft Impacts allow effective punch combat

Other Things
-Sonic Spinball-Getting smaller and also increases speed, but no control without getting out of spinball
-Kirby Multi Jump-Inflation gives you a bigger hitbox but also allows you to stay in air
-Yoshi Grabs-put into mouth, spit out in a certian direction
	-When on ground-Turns into a submission
-Dhalsim punches

Why box2d
-Combat can be modularized
	-Midair, similar to on ground
	-Important for making characters quickly, less time spent on animations, more time spent on gameplay
-Velocity is the important part
	-As velocity increases, damage increases
		-This makes keepaway tactics much more about small taps
		-This makes rushdown much stronger



Some things to Consider
-Kicks-Apply force to both the other body and your own
-Punches-Applys forces only to other body

To make a kick work properly, i would need a prismatic joint
-however prismatic joints won't work properly by themselves since their joints are locked
-Adding more bodies will cause more weight, however I don't think it should considered to big of a problem



The reason why a single body isn't going to work for blob foot
-I get the net angle of the suction
-I apply force
-If there is a whole in the center, I have a problem

What I can do alternatively is create a Prismatic joint
however, that won't turn right as it will spread out like a star rather than like a point as we want it

Its also possible I can have an internal ring around the main
-this would work, however it may result in more problems

I could also create a Wheel joint instead of distance joint for each
-However, this makes no difference in that its the shocks that I want to apply pressure to, not the wheel

I could look up the line joint 

No matter the aspect, it looks like I'm running into an issue
