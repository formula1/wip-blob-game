Shadows, Spirits, ghosts
These will probably be the main method of combat to make sure that I don't get involved with any rediculousness
in terms of collisions. I want to avoid frustrating collisions at all costs

For this reason, I believe most of the combat should be done by Ghosts
In this way the only combat that is done is between Dynamic bodies and thus reduces the possibility
of having bad collisions

Shadow
-Shadows Follow you but are delayed by a little bit
-This forces a player to think 30 seconds ahead

Avatar
-Avatars stop your current actions as a blob and you move as the ghost itself,
-If you stop using the avatar, it falls asleep but remains in the last position you left it

Whisperer
-Whisperer appear on you sholders but are not active
-Whenever you use them for an action, they remain in the spot that you did it for the full motion
-After its done, it tries to go back to you
-You must balance being close to the whisperer with the ability to hit and run

Guardian
-Moves With you
-Is always there, whether its in front, behind, below or inside, it will always be there
-This is the most basic


Stalker
-Moves to and Attacks Closest Opponent


Ideas
-Pokemon-Your attack calls it over so that it may get stronger
--Cute-First needs love, follows you
--Defender-Then attacks closest opponent but if you move to far runs to you
--Loyal-Attacks closest opponent until you call it
--Bezerker-Then attacks closest opponent, your calls only make it stronger
	The idea here is that at first the ghost needs you, at the end, you need the ghost
